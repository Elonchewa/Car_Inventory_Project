#Car inventory

Two programs. First is the inventory editor:

#Take a car Brand name, model, make year, and MPG
#multiple models of the same brand

The second is inventory user search:

#Lets user search through inventory
#They can filter it through any of the parameters
#If using a brand name, it will display the ones available and the user types the one they want
#They would need to select a brand name before searching for a model, but the program would display the models available within that brand
#If using make year, the user can put in a range of numbers they want and the program will display the car
#If using MPG, the user can input a range of MPG they want
#If no value is found it will tell them "No results. Let's try to find you something else."
